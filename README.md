# Freelance Marketplace

Freelance marketplace created from scratch without any libraries or frameworks.

Project goals:

- Allow freelances to have online profiles
- Allow freelancers to be paid via easy methods like M-Pesa
- Allow companies, organisations and individuals to post jobs.
- Allow the job posters to receive bids on the job from qualified freelancers
- Allow the job posters to review freelancer profiles to help them with the selection
- After selecting they work in a virtual office with specific milestones tracked where key deliverables are structured until delivery
- Ratings and reviews for both clients and freelancers after jobs

- Learn `php`
- Improve my `SQL` and databases knowledge
