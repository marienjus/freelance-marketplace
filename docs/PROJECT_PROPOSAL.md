For many people, Information Technology (IT) is basically synonymous with the people you call when you need help with a computer issue. While that view of information technology isn’t totally wrong, it drastically understates the scope of this critical career field. The most basic information technology definition is that it's the application of technology to solve personal, business or organizational problems on a broad scale. No matter the role, a member of an IT department works with others to solve technology problems, both big and small. A better definition is that Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. (“Information technology on Wikipedia”) 

Information technology has had overwhelmingly positive effects on our lives today. \
Example, we have easy, fast and cheap communication. It is easier, faster and cheaper to communicate with a person on the other side of the world today than one trying to communicate with someone in a nearby village a century ago. (Rogers and Forbes, 2019) This allows people and businesses to strengthen interpersonal relationships. It allows easy self-expression for all kinds of people. Additionally, we have great online education and ease of research. Information that was previously locked up in libraries and other expensive sources is now a google search away. People learn art, science and business online via websites like Youtube. A Kenyan athlete, Julius Yego who competes in the Javelin throw during the world Olympics learned how to do that on Youtube. (Bonesteel, YouTube taught javelin thrower Julius Yego wins gold at world championships, 2015.) It has also made it easier to trade. Transactions are much easier and more efficient than they once were. On the consumer side, inventions like the credit card and the emergence of e-commerce have made it easier than ever before for businesses to sell products and services to consumers at their convenience. Foreign transactions like these are much easier now and they may even get easier as the blockchain, which is an emerging technology, gains traction. Healthcare has also been improved by it a lot. We have ​​health apps that track chronic illnesses and communicate vital information to doctors and others that help you track diet, exercise, and mental health information. Virtual reality is also being used to train future surgeons and for actual surgeons to practice operations.

With technology, work has never been easier. Technology in the workplace has helped workers become more efficient than ever before. What used to take hours now can take minutes. Messages can be sent instantly to colleagues or clients across the world.  (Jared Spataro and Microsoft 365, 2020) Payments or proposals can be transferred almost immediately. Collaboration is also sometimes simpler to achieve – even when colleagues are not physically in the same place: Teams can hold meetings remotely with video-conferencing technology and work on the same shared documents at once with cloud-based file-sharing tools like Google Drive. The biggest impact of technology in the workplace is the actual workplace itself. While most jobs still require you to clock-in and work onsite, there are plenty of open positions for people looking to work remotely all over.

You are no longer limited to looking for jobs in your area. Technology has changed both where job-seekers look for work and where companies find talented candidates. (MBO Partners, 2019) You can go to the internet, use any number of job-seeking sites and find remote jobs or positions available to freelancers from anywhere. Companies can hire qualified candidates half a world away if they choose to, and often hire this way for part time/ contract jobs especially after the COVID-19 pandemic

In many sectors, getting a job has never been easier. Professionals have access to remote jobs from almost every corner of the world. Some examples of these industries are: software development, writing, data entry, design, sciences, sales and marketing, accounting, legal services, e.t.c. However, we have a huge number of professionals graduating with high in-demand skills but struggling to get jobs and gain experience. (Ramadhan and Otieno, 2019) It is because the jobs require experience and they require jobs to get experience. Some of these professionals even try but fail to secure unpaid work. This is because most companies need experience. We also have multiple companies and organisations that need such professionals but are afraid of making long term commitments with individuals without sufficient experience due to legal risk and the high cost of managing human capital. Individuals without experience require training and some hand holding which these companies do not want to do because of the time and financial burden

To overcome this problem, a freelancing marketplace can be created that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital by getting individuals to work for them on a short term basis.

<h2>Background of research </h2>


In Kenya, we have large numbers of professionals complaining that they cannot get jobs. These professionals are graduating with skills in software development, writing, data entry, design, sciences, sales and marketing, accounting, legal services, e.t.c. They, however, struggle to get started and gain experience in such high-in-demand industries. It is because the jobs require experience and they require jobs to get experience.

Companies also claim that they are struggling to find skilled professionals. (Roussi and Financial Times, 2021) We have multiple companies and organisations that need the above-mentioned professionals but are afraid of making long term commitments with individuals without sufficient experience due to legal risk and the cost of managing human capital. 

To overcome these problems, a freelancing marketplace can be used. It will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital by getting individuals to work for them on a short term basis. This is already being used in Europe and in the USA where in 2019, an MBO Partners’ survey found that nearly 41.1 million Americans identified themselves as freelancers, whether it was a few hours a month or a full-time arrangement. To break that down a little further, nearly 15 million workers claimed to be part-time freelancers, and 12.4 million called themselves full-time freelancers! (MBO Partners, 2019)

<h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement</h2>


We have a huge number of professionals graduating with high in-demand skills. They, however, struggle to get started and gain experience in these industries. Jobs require experience and they require jobs to get experience. A sort of chicken-and-egg problem. We also have multiple companies and organisations that need such professionals but are afraid of making long term commitments with individuals without sufficient experience due to legal risk and the high cost of managing human capital. To overcome this problem, a freelancing marketplace can be created that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital by getting individuals to work for them on a short term basis.

<h2 id="aim-of-research">Aim of research</h2>


Create a freelancing marketplace that will connect talented professionals with economic opportunities and give organisations access to affordable and low risk human capital.

<h2 id="objectives-of-research">Objectives of research</h2>


The main objective is to create a freelancing marketplace that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital in Kenya. This will be achieved by the following specific objectives:



1. To review related marketplaces built for use in Europe and the USA. Then identify their strengths and weaknesses.
2. To explore the known existing research done and unlock unknown possibilities of the research. 
3. Develop a logical design for the proposed system.
4. To create a user interface design, database design, UML diagrams and a conceptual architecture for the proposed system.
5. To implement and test the system and come up with an evaluation plan.

<h2 id="justifications-of-the-research">Justifications of the research</h2>


In Kenya, we have around 30000 graduates each year. (Ramadhan and Otieno, 2019) These graduates are mostly young and hungry, looking for places to get experience and hopefully earn an income. The traditional job pool cannot handle these huge numbers year after year. Even if it could, companies are mainly looking for experienced professionals. This problem can be solved by having a framework in which these graduates can get some experience without necessarily getting full time employment. Maybe working part-time or on a need-to basis for companies in need of a particular skill.

Organisations in Kenya are struggling to find skilled, talented and experienced candidates to fill in job slots. This is being made worse by multinationals like Microsoft that are also trying to recruit such staff and offering them around 5X the average salaries. It is getting increasingly difficult to hire new talent as the heavyweights take the best candidates out of the market.  (Roussi and Financial Times, 2021) This is leading to companies spending a lot of money on recruitment and retainment, raising the costs of managing human capital. All this is happening while the job market is flooded with recent graduates (that are inexperienced). We can help these companies relieve their staffing pressure by giving them access to a low cost and low risk pool of candidates. These candidates can start working part-time on non-critical work as they get the necessary experience then maybe get full time employment once the experience level is what is needed by the companies.

We have around 6.378 billion smartphones in the world. (Turner and Bank my cell, 2021) These phones have had countless applications in medicare, education, research and even military use cases. Many people can’t spend one hour without looking at their phones and laptops. We can use these devices to our advantage. The unemployed can use these devices while at home to do tasks for companies. This will both be a source of income to the unemployed and will relive the human labour costs for the companies involved. 

<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>


The scope of the project is as follows:



* Allow freelances to have online profiles.
* Allow freelancers to be paid via easy methods like M-Pesa.
* Money to be held in escrow to help in preventing fraud.
* Allow companies, organisations and individuals (job posters) to post jobs.
* Allow the job posters to receive bids on the job from qualified freelancers.
* Allow the job posters to review freelancer profiles to help them with the selection.
* After selecting they work in a virtual office with specific milestones tracked where key deliverables are structured until delivery.
* Ratings and reviews for both clients and freelancers after jobs.
* Notifications. The system should be able to notify the freelancers and job posters of actions that require their attention.
* Dispute resolution between the clients and applicants to be done by staff.
* Admin section and Generation of reports. There should be an admin app that can be used to manage customers, freelancers and postings. There will be reports like jobs posted, payments gone through, e.t.c

<h2 id="research-organisation">Research organisation</h2>


In chapter 2, the review of related work will consist of a detailed literature review of similar papers. It discusses the aims, objectives, and other solutions of other authors that had simulated or built similar marketplaces. It involves knowledge of microphones and cameras that were tested and yield relevant results. Chapter 3 research methodology, focuses on the design methodology used to accomplish the project. The software implementations of the designs are discussed in this chapter. While chapter 4 system analysis will involve the description of the current systems, their strengths and weaknesses plus their feasibility study. We will figure out the data captured by the current system, and the relationship between the data outputs from the system. We will also deal with the design of the system. In chapter 5, the system design of the proposed system will focus on the design methodology used to accomplish the project. The software implementations of the designs are discussed in this chapter.  Chapter 6 will deal with implementation system & testing: the system will be implemented and we will figure out how it will be tested. Chapter 7 will have the conclusions, findings & recommendations: summarizes the project in conclusions, limitations, and future works of the project.

<h2 id="history-of-the-research-topic">History of the research topic</h2>


Our earliest written evidence for 'freelance' comes from Sir Walter Scott's Ivanhoe, in which a lord refers to his paid army of 'free lances'. When freelance first came into English in the early 1800s, it was used to refer to a medieval mercenary who would fight for whichever nation or person paid them the most. (Merriam Webster) It is clear that freelancers existed before freelancing platforms existed. However, it is difficult to say which the first freelance platform was, as there are some big freelancing platforms that merged with other sites, or were bought out by other sites. For example, Elance was probably one of the earliest sites - being founded in 1999, and oDesk in 2003. These sites then merged to form Upwork in 2013. PeoplePerHour started up in 2007. Freelancer started in 2009 and purchased other freelancing sites, some of which were founded back in 2001 and 2004. It’s fair to say that these freelancing platforms made freelancing a possibility for the masses in Europe and the USA, and created the huge marketplace for all types of work that we see today.

<h2 id="review-of-related-systems">Review of related systems</h2>


Upwork https://www.upwork.com, a platform created by combining the former Elance and ODesk platforms, lets you find your next favorite freelancer by either searching for candidates on the site, or posting a job and letting people apply. Once you’re set up, you will likely be impressed with the wide range of freelancer skills and prices on the site. The platform makes it easy to work with freelancers – you can schedule chats, send messages, exchange files, and give feedback. One major problem is the job posting process that seems to be a bit complicated – you have to set up your company and then fill out an eight-page form. Another issue is that there seems to be a lot of spam. Task postings get a lot of low quality and unrelated applications.

Fiverr https://www.fiverr.com is a platform that connects freelancers with business owners looking for services in various digital projects, including website design, content writing, and voice-overs. Instead of sending out bids, sellers can sign up for free, list their gigs, and set their prices. Meanwhile, buyers can simply browse through different categories to purchase. This mostly favors big projects. Whenever a buyer purchases a gig, the system automatically charges their account and puts the money on hold. The system will then take a commission fee and send freelancers 80% of the offered price. Depending on each freelancer’s seller level, it can take up to 14 days to withdraw their earnings. There are multiple options to withdraw the payments, such as debit card, PayPal, and wire transfer. 

A review of most common marketplaces in Europe and the USA show a major problem: They do not support Kenyan payment methods. Common payment methods like M-Pesa and Equitel that the regular kenyan uses are not available. Locally, I was able to find only one major freelancing site: Kuhustle https://www.kuhustle.com. One major problem is that applicants have to pay in order to bid.

The above platforms shadow similar problems. For example,  they are bloated and have too many features. It might be better to focus on the most needed features. They often have a complex interface and are not easy to use. As a result of the point above and other reasons, they often come with complicated tutorials with instructions that take time to learn. They often charge high service/commission and have a long payment process. Some even charge the freelancers when applying! A lot of fake spam applicants and fake clients are on the platforms. This is especially common for low paying tasks.

<h2 id="emerging">Emerging</h2>


The internet is becoming very instrumental to our modern-day lives. From free international internet calls, fleet management- where companies know where and how fast their cars are going to intelligent sensors with extensive use cases in agriculture and even water plus electricity supply management through IoT. Their use cases are also trickling down to homes and to the individual (eg: e-commerce, social media, smart glasses, fitness bands, e.t.c) and companies worldwide. People are using internet apps to control smart homes with automatic lights, smart security systems, and smart appliances.

There is also a huge uptake in remote working. (MBO Partners, 2019) The COVID-19 pandemic forced small, medium, and large enterprises to adapt quickly into remote working. Work will probably never be the same as it was before. While some companies quickly adopted remote work during the pandemic, others embraced it slowly and reluctantly. Going forward businesses will likely have remote working as a key tool to maintain business continuity. Remote work is here to stay, whether mandated by employers or due to employees' personal choices. Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO, shared some staggering numbers in April 2020. They saw more than 200 million Microsoft Teams, a remote coworking video service, meeting participants in a single day, generating more than 4.1 billion meeting minutes. Also, Teams now has more than 75 million daily active users, and two-thirds of them have shared, collaborated, or interacted with files on Teams as well. As Satya put it, “We’ve seen two years’ worth of digital transformation in two months. From remote teamwork and learning, to sales and customer service, to critical cloud infrastructure and security—we are working alongside customers every day to help them adapt and stay open for business in a world of remote everything.” (Jared Spataro and Microsoft 365, 2020)

<h2 id="gap">Gap</h2>


The system being built will be easy and intuitive to use. It will not require training / a manual and the app will be intuitive to use. I will focus on the most needed features and have an intuitive user interface. It Kenyan payment methods. Common payment methods like M-Pesa and that are available to the regular kenyan. The service fees will be extremely affordable. Task applicants will not be charged to apply. Companies will not be charged to post. The commision will only be charged on transactions. Applicants will only receive payment 24 hours after service delivery to ensure fake ones are weeded out. The clients will also have to pay before posting and their money to be held in escrow to ensure they are not fake. The payment can be refunded if not satisfied with the service.

<h1 id="3-research-methodology">3. Research methodology</h1>


<h2 id="methodology-for-literature-review">Methodology for literature review</h2>


I will go through recent research on such systems as well as an overview of other similar websites in Europe and the USA.

<h2 id="methodology-for-data-collection-and-analysis">Methodology for data collection and analysis</h2>


The research will be conducted by sharing questionnaires with professionals in communities around me. I aim to have around 50-100 respondents.

Additionally, I aim to do around 10 face to face interviews with professionals.

<h2 id="system-design">System design</h2>


The server architecture, flow charts, sequence diagrams, and database ERD will be done on LucidChart. This is a free and easy-to-use tool.

The system prototypes will be done via Adobe XD.

<h2 id="system-testing">System testing</h2>


The system will be tested using fake simulated users manually.

<h2 id="system-deployment">System deployment</h2>


The system deployment will be of a cutover/big bang at every point in time. All the users move from one system to another at the same time on a given date. This is to ensure quick implementation time, lower costs and only one system at a given point in time.
