# 1. Introduction {#1-introduction}


## Motivation and background *

For many people, Information Technology (IT) is basically synonymous with the people you call when you need help with a computer issue. While that view of information technology isn’t totally wrong, it drastically understates the scope of this critical career field. The most basic information technology definition is that it's the application of technology to solve personal, business or organizational problems on a broad scale. No matter the role, a member of an IT department works with others to solve technology problems, both big and small. A better definition is that Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to create, process, store, retrieve and exchange all kinds of electronic data and information. (“Information technology on Wikipedia”) 

Information technology has had overwhelmingly positive effects on our lives today. \
Examples:



* Easy, fast and chap communication. It is easier, faster and cheaper to communicate with a person on the other side of the world today than one trying to communicate with someone in a nearby village a century ago. This allows people and businesses to strengthen interpersonal relationships. It allows easy self-expression for all kinds of people.
* Online education and ease of research. Information that was previously locked up in libraries and other expensive sources is now a google search away. People learn art, science and business online via websites like Youtube. A Kenyan athlete, Julius Yego who competes in the Javelin throw during the world Olympics learned how to do that on Youtube. (Bonesteel, YouTube taught javelin thrower Julius Yego wins gold at world championships.) 
* Easier trade. Transactions are much easier and more efficient than they once were. On the consumer side, inventions like the credit card and the emergence of e-commerce have made it easier than ever before for businesses to sell products and services to consumers at their convenience. Foreign transactions like these are much easier now and they may even get easier as the blockchain, which is an emerging technology, gains traction.
* Healthcare. We have ​​health apps that track chronic illnesses and communicate vital information to doctors and others that help you track diet, exercise, and mental health information. Virtual reality is also being used to train future surgeons and for actual surgeons to practice operations.


## Background of research  {#background-of-research}

In Kenya, we have large numbers of professionals complaining that they cannot get jobs. Jobs require experience and they require jobs to get experience. Professionals are graduating with skills in software development, writing, data entry and design, sciences, sales and marketing, accounting, legal services, e.t.c. They, however, struggle to get started and gain experience in these industries. \
Companies also claim that they are struggling to find skilled professionals. We have multiple companies and organisations that need the above-mentioned professionals but are afraid of making long term commitments with individuals without sufficient experience due to legal risk and the cost of managing human capital. To overcome this problem, a freelancing marketplace can be created that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital by getting individuals to work for them on a short term basis.


## Problem statement {#problem-statement}

We have a huge number of professionals graduating with high in-demand skills. They, however, struggle to get started and gain experience in these industries. We also have multiple companies and organisations that need such professionals but are afraid of making long term commitments with individuals without sufficient experience due to legal risk and the cost of managing human capital. To overcome this problem, a freelancing marketplace can be created that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital by getting individuals to work for them on a short term basis.


## Aim of research {#aim-of-research}

Create a freelancing marketplace that will connect talented individuals with economic opportunities and help organisations cut down on the cost of managing human capital in Kenya.


## Objectives of research {#objectives-of-research}

The main objectives of this research are:



* Allow freelances to have online profiles
* Allow freelancers to be paid via easy methods like M-Pesa
* Allow companies, organisations and individuals to post jobs.
* Allow the job posters to receive bids on the job from qualified freelancers
* Allow the job posters to review freelancer profiles to help them with the selection
* After selecting they work in a virtual office with specific milestones tracked where key deliverables are structured until delivery
* Ratings and reviews for both clients and freelancers after jobs


## Justifications of the research *

We have around 6.378 billion smartphones in the world. (Turner and Bank my cell) These phones have had countless applications in medicare, education, research and even military use cases. Many people can’t spend 1 hour without looking at their phones and laptops. We can use these devices to our advantage.


## Scope {#scope}

The scope of the project is as follows:



* Notifications. The system should be able to notify the freelancers and job posters of actions that require their attention.
* Admin section. There should be an admin app that can be used to manage customers, freelancers and postings.
* Generation of reports. There will be reports like jobs posted, payments gone through, e.t.c
* Authentication. Users will have an email and password used to access the marketplace.
* Authorisation. Users will only have access to their related jobs and admins can see all of them.


## Research organisation {#research-organisation}

Research Methodology: focuses on the design methodology used to accomplish the baby monitor project. The software implementations of the designs are discussed in this chapter.

Review of related work: consists of a detailed literature review of similar papers. It discusses the aims, objectives, and other solutions of other authors that had simulated or built similar marketplaces. It involves knowledge of microphones and cameras that were tested and yield relevant results.

System Analysis: This will involve the description of the current systems, their strengths and weakness plus their feasibility study. We will figure out the data captured by the current system, and the relationship between the data outputs from the system. We will also deal with the design of the system.

System Design of the proposed system: focuses on the design methodology used to accomplish the baby monitor project. The software implementations of the designs are discussed in this chapter. 

Implementation System & Testing: The system will be implemented and we will figure out how it will be tested.

Conclusions, findings & recommendations: summarizes the project in conclusions, limitations, and future works of the baby monitor project

# 2. Research methodology {#2-research-methodology}


## Methodology for literature review {#methodology-for-literature-review}

I will go through recent research on such systems as well as an overview of other similar websites in Europe and the USA.


## Methodology for data collection and analysis {#methodology-for-data-collection-and-analysis}

The research will be conducted by sharing questionnaires with professionals in communities around me. I aim to have around 50-100 respondents.

Additionally, I aim to do around 10 face to face interviews with professionals.


## System design {#system-design}

The server architecture, flow charts, sequence diagrams, and database ERD will be done on LucidChart. This is a free and easy-to-use tool.

The system prototypes will be done via Adobe XD.


## System testing {#system-testing}

The system will be tested using fake simulated users manually.


## System deployment {#system-deployment}

The system deployment will be of a cutover/big bang at every point in time. All the users move from one system to another at the same time on a given date. This is to ensure quick implementation time, lower costs and only one system at a given point in time.

# 3. Review of related work {#3-review-of-related-work}


## Review {#review}

A review of current marketplaces in Europe and the USA shows a few problems:



* Bloated. They have too many features. It might be better to focus on the most needed features.
* Not easy to use. As a result of the point above and other reasons, they often come with complicated instructions that take time to learn.


## Emerging {#emerging}

The internet and our devices are becoming very instrumental to our modern-day lives. From fleet management- where companies know where and how fast their cars are going to sensors with extensive uses cases in agriculture and even water plus electricity supply management.

Their use cases are also trickling down to homes and to the individual (eg: e-commerce, social media, smart glasses, fitness bands, e.t.c). People are using the internet to control smart homes with automatic lights, smart security systems, and smart appliances.


## Gap {#gap}

The system being built will be:



* Easy to use. It will not require training / a manual and the app will be intuitive to use.
